# Hash-Calculator

## Nuget package: HashCalculator Version 1.1.0.2

This is a simple Hash code calculator library targeting .Net Framework 4.7.2. It provides support of calculating hash code of
any file and return its hash code in string representation.

## Following Hash algorithm is supported.

* SHA1
* SHA256
* SHA384
* SHA512
* RIPEMD160
* MD5

## Usage

 This nuget package is fairly simple and straight forward. It contains one simple static class and two method ComputeHash and ComputeHashAsync.

 To use, simply add the nuget package in your project by:

* From Package management console in Visual Studio: Install-Package HashCalculator -Version 1.1.0.2

* From Dotnet CLI: dotnet add package HashCalculator --version 1.1.0.2
 and call the function in your program: HashCalculator.HashComputer.ComputeHash("PATH/TO/YOUr/FILE", "ALGORITHM")

* If the file you need to calculate its hash is going to be very large in size, you may consider do this asynchronously by
  calling ComputeHashAsync("PATH/TO/YOUR/FILE", "ALGORITHM")

* To pass algorithm simple pass it in String as "SHA1", "SHA256", "SHA384", "SHA512", "RIPEMD160", "MD5".

* Please **be aware** that both synchronous method and asynchronous method throws FileNotFoundExceptions for incorrect path to file
  and Exception for possible wrong algorithm name.
